# Rayan-s-Projects
This is a Python and mysql based application with a MySQL backend, which can be used a task manager and allows the user to keep a track of his tasks.(To do list) 

Users can add, view, delete, and mark tasks as done, with tasks stored permanently in a database. 

The interface is user friendly and i also made it dark-themed for better readability.

I've learned alot of things while making this project.
Certain modules like tkinter helped me in making a GUI for the user for a better interface

I've also added a small easter egg to make it more user friendly.
